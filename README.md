# VBA_stock_analysis
Module 2 Challenge 

## Overview of Project
To create code to help analyize stock data and output simple to read information for financial analysis.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build the same code two different ways and see how building the code changed the run time of the stock analysis code.

## Analysis and Challenges
I am building code to analyze stock data and see the profit or loss on renewable energy stocks. Some challenges will be getting the different stocks and tickers to calculate on their own. As well as the conditional and for loops that are going to be needed to input, interpret, output, and finally format our analysis all on its own. 

### Results Based on Original Formula

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Syntax with VBA is EVERYTHING and I can not stress that enough. Often times while trying to debug a mistake it was something as simple as a misspelled word, or something as complex as not having something positioned right in your for loop. Working with VBA forces you to break down your code into bite sized chunks and pieces to create something simple like a table of analized stock data. The challenge with VBA is learning and getting the syntax to cooperate. Once you do that it is really easy write code that would make repetitive day to day tasks like analyzing stocks simple.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
